### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

This assignment was very self learning and reading documentation to learn a lot of what needed to be done. The labs were helpful for some set up but after basic functionality was when I needed to dive deeper into prisma documentation to see what functions they have.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added the comments if I had more time. This was a large project and given that this was my first time having my own back-end I am happy with the work I did I just would have liked more time.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

We have not project demos yet, so I will fill this out once we do that.

### Open-source libraries used

- react-router-dom

### Shout out

I would like to shoutout Daniel Fuentes, Nicholas Matias, and Axel Hernandex for being helpful and for talking through our issues together. Even though we had different implementations, us helping each other when we got stuck and looking through documentation together solidified more of the concepts that we learned in the lab. Being able to talk about how we did things at a high level and understand what the other did is something I found really cool by the end of this week.
